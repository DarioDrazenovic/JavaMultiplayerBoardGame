# JavaMultiplayerBoardGame
A multiplayer board game called "Concept" made fully in java and SceneBuilder using sockets and multithreading.
Added a functioning replay system using SAX/DOM libraries to save and read data dinamically
Using synchronisation I sucesfully locked threads so each can do it's job in the right time during saving and reading of data and during replay.
